## Meeting Minutes Bullets

- Team agreed on the need for a skeleton that encompasses the tech stack that was tentatively agreed upon during the first meeting.
- [Repo](https://github.com/danybeltran/nextjs-typescript-and-mongodb) will be used to derive inspiration for this skeleton (Adi).
- Team has agreed to individually work on above repo until end of day tomorrow (March 4) so that each member gains an understanding of the full tech stack in a minimal way and so that further work items can actually be created based on the existence of this skeleton.
- The best skeleton that the team comes up with, as decided by PR process, will be merged in by eod March 4th.
- Team agreed that approvals on code-less items will be provided by comments on user stories.
- Team agreed that approvals on code items will be provided by comments on the linked PRs.
- Team has agreed to complete the `git clone` work by end of day today (March 3) by commenting on each other's stories.
- Team members will move their stories into **Done** column after review is complete on their item.
- **Adi** will ensure that each team member has code tasks soon as possible on/after Sunday(March 5)
- **Adi** will work on getting meeting notes for meeting 1 into PR state. Team agreed to rotate this responsibility per meeting.
- [Code Sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/) was deemed as an alternative to local development and as a way to provide a live run of the app using a public github repo + free code sandbox account (**Adi**)
- Suggestion made to have the user login end to end workflow be the first set of user stories to follow the 'skeleton' work (**Sumrish**) Team agrees.
